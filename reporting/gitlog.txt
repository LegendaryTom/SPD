2014-04-30 13:28:35 -0400 demo version, mostly needs to be rewritten
2014-04-30 13:31:46 -0400 Initial base code. Not producing svg yet.
2014-04-30 13:48:04 -0400 Start of rewrite.
2014-04-30 13:51:48 -0400 Cleaned up draw.js header info
2014-04-30 13:55:39 -0400 Renamed draw.html to index.html
2014-05-02 12:14:38 -0400 Basic functionality working.
2014-05-02 16:35:45 -0400 Cleaned up, added a default sting number in the dropdown. Added a project report markdown file.
2014-05-05 09:24:00 -0400 Updated documentaion
2014-05-06 16:53:24 -0400 Lots of code cleanup. Started orgaizing global variables. Started the move away from SVG.js. Added a few details, and started the inverter section.
2014-05-07 17:08:13 -0400 More code cleanup. Moved SVG text away from library. Switched text to multi-line. Started modeling inverter box. Added sample component container, and system config object.
2014-05-09 16:18:46 -0400 Added option to specify the layers and blocks on seperate lines than the element declaration. This allows the addition of elements in a more natural flow ( set layer, add line, add line, set new layer, start block, add circle, ...). Added more system variables, and started to make the drawing adapt to them. The number of AC conductors is dependent on the AC type. Added more part location and size information. Continued the path to the AC disconect. Simplified the page by removing the tabs. Lots of cleanup along the way.
2014-05-12 17:09:40 -0400 Added semicolons to main file. Though they are optional 98% of the time, they seem to be used by most programers.
2014-05-12 17:17:37 -0400 Renamed project document to README.md, the standard name for online repositories
2014-05-12 17:48:48 -0400 Started to restructure the drawing making portion. In stead of different areas of the drawing bing made in seperate functions, they will be made in one long function. Before, everything was in a tree structure of blocks. After, blocks will be used and reused as need (CAD style). The block function needs to changed, and the mk_drawing function needs to be cleaned up.
2014-05-12 20:04:53 -0400 Altered block function to work with new drawing format. Blocks will only be used for certain groupings of elements that need to be repeated. The block instance inheirets the elements, then adds a new coor. The AVG writeing function will have to account for the new structure.
2014-05-13 12:56:30 -0400 Updated project readme.
2014-05-13 14:40:18 -0400 Updated documentation.
2014-05-13 16:01:49 -0400 Finished restructure. All the drawing happens in one function (to be called on update). The block function was split into three (block_start, block_end, and block to use a previusly recorded block). The page loads without errors, but is not drawing correclty. The display_svg function needs to be restructured to handle blocks.
2014-05-13 17:01:50 -0400 Removed all use of Jquery from javascript. Commented out the load in the html file.
2014-05-13 19:26:23 -0400 Started updating drawing_svg to match new structure. It might be good to store layer info or name in the elemement object.
2014-05-14 16:36:31 -0400 Finished layer and block assignment. The layer name is assigned to the element, and the elements are added to a single array instead of a set of layer arrays. The display_svg function has been updated to the new format. The PV array is displaying corectly, but has some errors when the string number is changed.
2014-05-15 10:58:54 -0400 Back to a working drawing with the new format. Ready to merge with main branch.
